# Function 
## What is function ?
This workshop is an introduction to Functions and Functional Programming in Java8. We are going to learn the new code syntax but also we are going to practice new programming concepts and new ways of solving problems with Functional mechanisms added to Java 8.

## How does it work ?
+  In the first part we will learn how to use new syntax to define functions. How to create a function and how to compose multiple functions together.
+ In the second part we will understand concept of a function as a value and how passing a function to method can help avoid repeatition in code.
+ In the next part finally we are going to walk through plenty of new functional intefaces like BiFunction,Consumer or Prediicate which were added to Java 8.
+ Part four is about "function as a result value" - we will see how to return a function from a method , how to do dependency injection in Functional Style and what is "Currying"
+ Next part will be about the real world and how to use pure functions when we need to deal with exceptions and missing values.
+ We will finish by looking at some theoretical examples to gain broader understanding of a concept of encapsualtion and why Referential Transparency is crucial in Functional Programming.


# Our last words for today :-
Generally speaking, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.
