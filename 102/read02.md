## What is the difference between Git and GitHub :question:
what's the difference? Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

## How can we Log into Github through Riplet and what is the purpose of this action :question:
1- Import open-source projects from GitHub to Replit so that we can run them or modify them  
2- Integrate your own GitHub account with your Replit account so that you can work on your private projects  
3- Push changes back to open-source projects as pull requests.

## Commands and steps guiding orders through tools in CLI (Terminals) :question:  
+ ls : will list for me directories  
+ ls -la : List all files  
+ cd (Change Directory) : to open a certain directory(folder)  
+ cd ..  : to go back from my current directory(folder) to the previous one  
+ mkdir :(Make directory) to create a directory(folder)  
+ touch command, and don't forget the extension of the file  
+ pwd (Print Working Directory) : to see where I am now  
+ clear : clears the terminal  

#What does Git mean :question:  
Its version control system,it's on our local machine, we can see our files, what changes are made, why they are made and by who, the most popular commands using Git are add-commit-push which developers refer to them as ACP  

## Git Commands :  
![git](http://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/git-commands2.png) 
+ git clone (the link of my repo)    >to have my repo downloaded on my local machine  
+ git add .                           >when I do some changes on my file  
+ ![git](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Git-Architechture-Git-Tutorial-Edureka-2.png)  
+ git commit -m 'the message you want >to commit my changes
+ git push origin main                > in order to have my changes on GitHub (on the cloud) I use git push origin main

# Changing content automatically after working on it throught the terminal using ACP (git add . ,git commit -m ,push origin main) commands. 

+ You will be asked to provide your username and password of your GitHub account then using the last tool :  
+ git status                          >will give us an explanation about what's happening, the state of our repo, we can see the changes that we did and to see the tracked and untracked files AFTER we go back to GitHub, I refresh the page and I will see my changes that I added on my files and I can also see my commit messages
