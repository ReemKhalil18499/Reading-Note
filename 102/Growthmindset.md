# Growth Mind Set :question:

### Definition 
In decision theory and general systems theory, a mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notions held by one or more people or groups of people. A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life :relaxed:

#### there are 5 ways to maintain a growth mindset such as :
1- Challenges = You need to have great mental or physical effort in order to be able to do all types of challenges bravely !  :muscle:  
2- Obstacles = Action or situation that causes an obstruction. Different types of obstacles include physical, economic, biopsychosocial, cultural, political, technological and military that you may face in your life that u should make sure to get through wisely patiently   
3- Effort = physical or mental activity needed to achieve something , Trying hard and not giving up is a true road to succes and getting to your goals as a believer :sparkles:  
4- Criticism = Criticism is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something.Criticism is an evaluative or corrective exercise that can occur in any area of human life.  
5- Success of others = Whenever i see a person accomplishing an act thats beyond normal it makes me have the need to be part of the same act or better ! that is called inspiration . when you feel inspired by someone u automatically have the energy to want to acheivement and reach level better than where you already are :heart: thats why i think beiing inspired for wishing others the best has good effect on u as a person :sparkling_heart:
