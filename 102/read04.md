# What is JavaScript (JS) ?  
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language and Programming language used to make webpages interactive.    
![JS](https://www.javascript.ba/system/posts/images/000/001/163/original/1_1gByVzAtW0myl9e9CsGqhw.jpeg)  
It contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects  
 ### For Example :-  
 + Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.  
 + Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
