# Team Work  
Building that team takes time and patience, plus the ability to recognize a good organizational fit. There's no "perfect" team waiting out there for you, but you can find the right people to fill the roles and skill gaps you face. I advice you those steps :  

* Establish expectations from day one.  
* Respect your team members as individuals.  
* Engender connections within the team.  
* Practice emotional intelligence.   
* Motivate with positivity.   
* Communicate, communicate, communicate.   
* Look for ways to reward good work.  
* Diversify.

Your team is going to face problems throughout the year. How you respond to these issues will impact how much they trust you and each other, as well as how honest they are when the next issue arises. Build trust and help your team feel protected by remaining positive in your reactions and motivation.

# Why do we need a perfect team?  
A strong team is the foundation of a high-performing business and a good team ethic can be held largely accountable for the success and smooth running of the organization. If employees do not gel and work well together, problems can arise, such as poor organization, missed deadlines, and conflict within the workplace.
