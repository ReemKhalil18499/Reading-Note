# Images
The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.  
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.  
The img tag has two required attributes:  
src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.
