# HTML text fundamentals
+ In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a element, like so:

 Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:

One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.

# Introducing CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

#### WHY CSS?  
+ CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
+ Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
+ Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
+ Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.

#### CSS Syntax:
A CSS comprises style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block  


# JavaScript basics

+ JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.
+ JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

1.Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.  
2.Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.  
3.Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.  

# Decisions and Loops

### Looping Statements
There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths. A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages:  
Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the prog ram, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false. Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the prog ramming languages:
