# CSS Transforms  
The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.

# CSS Animations  
+ CSS animations is a proposed module for Cascading Style Sheets that allows the animation of HTML document elements using CSS.   
+ An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

# CSS @keyframes Rule  
The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.  
The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.  
During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.  
Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.  
Tip: For best browser support, you should always define both the 0% and the 100% selectors.  
Note: Use the animation properties to control the appearance of the animation, and also to bind the animation to selectors.  
Note: The !important rule is ignored in a keyframe (See last example on this page).  

# 404  
In general, 404 errors won’t impact your site’s search performance, and you can safely ignore them if you’re certain that the URLs should not exist on your site. It’s important to make sure that these and other invalid URLs return a proper 404 HTTP response code, and that they are not blocked by the site’s robots.txt file.
