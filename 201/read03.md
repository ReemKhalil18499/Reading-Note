# Whats HTML Lists?
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists

### Unordered HTML List  
An unordered list starts with the ul tag. Each list item starts with the li tag.  
The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

# The CSS Box Model  
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

+ Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear  
+ Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent  
+ Border - A border that goes around the padding and content  
+ Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent  

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.  


# js interactive box  
You've undoubtedly seen them, used them, and gotten annoyed by them while surfing the net. Now its time to learn how to create them- interactive dialog boxes, that is. With JavaScript, you can pump into your pages some life by using JavaScript controlled boxes. For example, you can have a box pop up asking surfers to type in his/her name and then display it accordingly. You can also have a confirmation box that gives users a choice whether or not to proceed with a specified action, such as enter a restricted site. These are among the endless possibilities that are out there; fortunately, there are only three methods (commands) you'll need to learn to be able to achieve all of them.  
The three "commands" involved in creating alert, confirm, and prompt boxes are:    
+ window.alert()   
+ window.confirm()  
+ window.prompt()


# Decisions and Loops  
This chapter compares number and string values, and explains how decision making is implemented in JavaScript and how one can use it to make the code smarter. In JavaScript, the flow of the code's execution can be changed depending on whether a condition is true or false, using an ’if’ statement or a switch statement. The chapter introduces some new operators that are essential for the definition of conditions. Comparison operators have a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS). The ’if’ statement is used in almost every program that is more than a couple of lines long. The while loop is useful for looping through some code for as long as a test condition remains true. The ’do … while’ loop executes the code once and then keeps executing the code as long as the test condition remains true.
